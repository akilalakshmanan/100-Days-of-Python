	<h4>Fun Facts of Bailey</h4>
	<div><p>Labradors have webbed toes and are therefore great swimmers. This webbing can also effectively act as a snowshoe in colder climates, as it keeps snow from collecting between their toes.</p>
	
	<p> Their coat has two layers: a short, thick topcoat and a relatively water-resistant undercoat. This two-layer coat protects them from cold and wet weather.
	They are the most commonly used breed for guide dogs. They are intelligent, easy to train, eager to please and have a gentle temperament.Labradors are the most popular dog breed in America & the UK.This breed loves to be around people and needs a lot of affection, as well as plenty of exercise to burn off all that energy!</p>

	<p>You can potentially get puppies of all colours (black, yellow and chocolate) in the same litter.The average life span for a Labrador is 10 â€“ 12 years.
	The Labrador breed actually originated in Newfoundland (Canada), not Labrador.</p></div>
