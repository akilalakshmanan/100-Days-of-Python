	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the most beautiful places to visit in Leh Ladakh in June is Zanskar Valley. Many people come here in cars or on bikes to experience the thrill of driving or &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;riding through this challenging terrain. It is simply an unforgettable experience. The roads here are navigable but extremely tricky. Once you reach Zanskar, you &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will be amazed by the clear blue streams, lakes and the glaciers which seem close enough to touch.</p> </div>

		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another of the best places to visit in Leh Ladakh would be the Magnetic Hill. It is located 30 km from Leh on the Leh-Kargil Highway. This place is a huge draw &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;because of the jaw-dropping feats of the magnetic hill which draws stationary vehicles up the slope, defying gravity. Travellers from all over the world have &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;experienced this phenomenon and it proves to be a popular attraction. Whether it’s an optical illusion or actual magnetic force, no one really knows but it’s &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;certainly a cool thing to see. Remember to carry snacks and water with you as this area doesn’t have any restaurants or eating joints. </p></div>

	<h2><i>Nubra Valley</i></h2>

		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nubra Valley’s beauty can be described as surreal and unearthly. This is one of the recommended places to visit in Leh Ladakh in July because the weather is &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pleasant and enjoyable. Most of the other time, the climate is too cold to enjoy. There are plenty of places to see here – Diskit, an isolated town on the edge of a &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;desert feels serene and peaceful. You can also visit other nearby places like Somoor and Panamik. Being in Nubra Valley is a revelation. To understand how &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;people can lead such a cocooned, yet difficult existence is an eye-opener. There are hot springs on the outskirts of Panamik exude an inviting warmth and are &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;great for a dip.</p></div>
